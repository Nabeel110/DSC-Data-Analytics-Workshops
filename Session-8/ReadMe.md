# Analysis on Real-World Dataset - Titanic 
### Predict who SURVIVED?

## This tutorial is aimed at beginners, especially those who are both new to machine learning/data science as well as python. 


1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) - understanding the data and the underlying interactions between the different variables
2. Data Pre-processing - preparing the data for modelling


The goal of the model is to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster, given their age, class and a few other features.
